# RentCars
It's my first project on ASP.NET Core platform.
I have added several pages for product display, login and admin panel. There are 3 types of users on the project: user, moderator and admin. The user has access only to the review of cars, the moderator has the ability to add, edit and delete cars, the admin has all the actions described above and the ability to assign roles. Created database of users and cars using Entity Framework.
I installed the entire project on hosting using Azure Cloud.
